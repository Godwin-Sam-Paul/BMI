# BMI Calculator App with GUI using Custom Tkinter

This project is a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator application developed in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using custom Tkinter. The application allows users to calculate their BMI by inputting their weight and height in various units, providing accurate BMI results and displaying it on a scale.

## Features

- **BMI Calculation:** Accurately calculates BMI based on user input for weight and height in different units (metric or imperial).
- **Custom GUI:** Utilizes Tkinter library to create a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
- **Visualization:** Displays the calculated BMI on a scale, offering a visual representation of the BMI range.
- **SQLite Database Integration:** Allows users to store calculated BMI values in an SQLite database.
- **History Functionality:** Includes a 'History' button within the app to access and view previously calculated BMI records from the database.
